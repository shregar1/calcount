# Utilities

## Purpose

In software engineering, **utilities** are helper modules that provide reusable functions and classes for common tasks (e.g., validation, JWT, dictionary manipulation).

In this project, the `utilities` folder contains utility classes for JWT handling, dictionary operations, and validation.

## Structure

```
utilities/
  dictionary.py
  jwt.py
  validation.py
```

- `dictionary.py`: Utility for dictionary and key transformation
- `jwt.py`: Utility for JWT token creation and decoding
- `validation.py`: Utility for input and security validation
